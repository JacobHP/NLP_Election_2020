# NLP_Election_2020

In this project I did an analysis of US election tweets scraped during October 2020. I scraped the tweets using Tweepy through the Twitter Developer API over a period of a few days (1 or 2 scrapes of 10000 tweets a night and retweets removed). 

I performed sentiment analysis using the NRC Lexicon, created wordclouds, explored popular hashtags, user creation dates and user locations. 

I also explored whether we could find clusters of tweets with similar characteristics using HDBSCAN and OPTICS with cosine dissimilarity on document vectors. However, this unfortunately did not prove particularly fruitful.
